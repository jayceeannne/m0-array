1. I felt cofident in this assignment up until I had to creat an array with 4 booleans. Everything after that was a struggle.
2. I don't understand pop, shift, and upshift. I googled each to try and understand what they even do but I found nothing helpful. I found how to create the code but nothing had an explanation to why.
3. My questions about arrays are listed above.
